# Part 1 - Linear Regression Writeup

After completing `a6_part1.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. What is the r squared value?  What does this say about this linear regression model?
The r-squared value indicates how well the linear regression model explains the variation in the data. A higher r-squared value suggests a stronger model, as it accounts for a greater proportion of the variation. For this dataset, the r-squared value was 0.79.

2. According to your model, what is the predicted systolic blood pressure for a person who is 42 years old?
Based on the model, the estimated systolic blood pressure for a 42-year-old individual is approximately 137.5.

3. How accurate do you think this model's predictions are?  Do you think this model is accurate enough to reliably predict someone's blood pressure based on their age?  Why or why not?  And if not, what could improve the model?
While a correlation of 0.79 is relatively strong, it’s not precise enough to reliably predict an individual’s blood pressure based solely on age, as blood pressure can vary greatly depending on personal health factors. To improve the model, increasing the dataset size and including more variables related to individual health could lead to more accurate predictions.
