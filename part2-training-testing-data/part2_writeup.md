# Part 2 - Training and Testing Data Writeup

After completing `a6_part2.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. What makes this model more effective than the model you created in the previous lesson?
This model is more effective than the one created in the previous lesson because it includes not only the training data but also the predictions and testing data. Additionally, the inclusion of training data helps assess the accuracy of the model.


2. What does the R squared coefficient tell you about the model?
The R-squared coefficient indicates that the linear relationship between age and blood pressure explains 62.6% of the variation in blood pressure.

3. Would you say that your model is accurate? What evidence supports your conclusion? Consider the meaning of the predicted and actual values in the context of the chart below from the American Heart Associationâ€™s website on understanding blood pressure.
I would consider my model accurate, as the test results align well with the predicted values. However, it may not be ideal for real-world use, since the error (r-value) tends to grow as age increases, leading to greater inaccuracies. Providing more data to the model could help improve its accuracy.
